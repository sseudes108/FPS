<p>Features:</p>
    <li> UIToolkit
    <li> Fullscreen Shader for the outline and fadeScreen effects
    <li> An Scriptable Object based event system
    <li> A Finite State Machine for the Player and the NPC's
    <li> A simple save system
    <li> Some free assets from https://www.cgtrader.com/welcome, https://itch.io/ and https://assetstore.unity.com/

<h2 align="center">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Lots of fun and learning. There are some things to toggle, but I will move on. The art is never finished, only abandoned. I've learned to use Scriptable Objects in a new way, learned the Full Shader Graphs, and gained valuable experience with the editor and the process of making a game. </p>

<p>Finished in 7/17/2024</p>
<strong>Thank you.</strong>
